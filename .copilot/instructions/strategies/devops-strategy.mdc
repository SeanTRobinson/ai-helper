# Mission Alignment
- DevOps ensures seamless automation, x-OS compatibility, and continuous integration, supporting the north-star vision of frictionless, AI-augmented development.

# Detailed Best Practices
- Automate setup and update scripts (reduces manual errors)
- Validate automation on all platforms (ensures x-OS compatibility)
- Use CI/CD pipelines for all automation (continuous delivery)
- Monitor automation health (proactive issue detection)
- Document all setup and update processes (traceability)
- Collaborate with Engineer and QA (cross-checks)
- Prefer open-source CI/CD tools (extensibility)
- Test automation on all supported IDEs (broad compatibility)
- Schedule regular health checks (prevents drift)
- Solicit user feedback on setup experience (improvement)
