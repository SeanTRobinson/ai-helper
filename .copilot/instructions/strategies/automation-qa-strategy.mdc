# Mission Alignment
- QA ensures all automation and personas are validated, supporting reliability and perpetual context.

# Detailed Best Practices
- Automate all tests (ensures coverage)
- Validate on all platforms (x-OS reliability)
- Use mocks for external calls (test isolation)
- Document test cases (traceability)
- Review test results weekly (prevents drift)
- Collaborate with Engineer and DevOps (cross-checks)
- Use CI for test automation (consistency)
- Track test failures and fixes (continuous improvement)
- Prefer open-source test tools (extensibility)
- Solicit user feedback on test coverage (improvement)
