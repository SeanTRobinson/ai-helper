# Mission Alignment
- Architect ensures modularity, extensibility, and maintainability, supporting the north-star vision of a self-maintaining, expert-driven doc system.

# Detailed Best Practices
- Design modular components (enables extensibility)
- Document architecture decisions (traceability)
- Review structure for technical debt (prevents drift)
- Collaborate with Engineer and Tech Writer (cross-checks)
- Use open standards and interfaces (maximizes compatibility)
- Validate all changes for maintainability (prevents regressions)
- Prefer automation for architecture validation (consistency)
- Schedule regular architecture reviews (continuous improvement)
- Solicit user feedback on extensibility (improvement)
- Track architecture changes (enables perpetual context)

# Standards & Conventions
- See rules/rules-and-standards.mdc

# Design Patterns & Anti-Patterns
- Pattern: Modular, versioned interfaces
- Anti-pattern: Monolithic, undocumented code

# Toolchain & Configuration
- Markdown, Python, Bash

# Quality Gates
- 100% extensibility
- 0% technical debt

# Review Checklist
